This post rereads Mike Arrington's 2010 article [Are You a Pirate?](https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/31/are-you-a-pirate/).

I've read this post before and had the pleasure of revisiting it when a friend sent it over. 

I've been thinking more about similar ideas: deviancy, variability, and risks, especially actions that are perceived as risky by the general population but are perhaps not that risky at all - there's an inevitability, a necessity to them.

On risk

> Entrepreneurs, though, are all screwed up. They donâ€™t need to be rewarded for risk, because they actually get utility out of risk itself. In other words, they like adventure.

On payouts

> The payouts for starting a business are just terrible when you account for risk. 

On adventure

> But I left the law after just three years to join a startup. And the reason I did it was adventure. I wanted to be in the game, not just watching it. 

Referencing the man in the arena

> Now that person is interesting. That person has stories to tell. That person is a man who has been in the arena.
