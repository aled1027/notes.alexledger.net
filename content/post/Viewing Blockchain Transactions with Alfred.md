# Navigating Blockchain Transactions with Alfred

Since I build a lot of software on blockchains, I often find myself navigating across blockchain explorers to view transactions, addresses, and contracts.

I wanted to test out better processes of quickly navigating a blockchain explorer. This doesn't totally scratch my itch. What I'd love is a command-k prompt for navigating blockchain explorers, similar command-k in Linear.app.

## Usage

To use this, I pull up Alfred with command-space and then type in `polygon addr` and then paste in the address I want to visit. 

```bash
polygon addr <address>
polygon tx <tx-hash>
```


### 1. Type in polygon addr in Alfred

### 3. Press enter and voila you're viewing the address on polygon scan!

## Configuration in Alfred

This uses the Alfred web search configuration.
