Very excited that Linear just added tabs. 
> The Linear desktop app now supports organizing work across multiple tabs. Tabs in Linear closely mirror the tab management features youâ€™re accustomed to in web browsers, including pinned tabs, drag to re-arrange, and a host of keyboard shortcuts. You can even use the command menu to search across your tabs by pressing T.
> 
> To get started, open a new tab with Cmd/Ctrl Tor by holding Cmd/Ctrl and clicking a link. If you don't see tabs in your desktop app yet, you may need to restart your app or download version 1.18 from linear.app/download.
