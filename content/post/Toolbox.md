| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)       | Spotlight alternative that is customizable, faster, and really fun to use.                                                      |
| [TextExpander](https://textexpander.com/)  | A macro-plugin for macs that lets you type in an abbreviation, like `zhello` and replaces the text with a pre-defined template. |
| [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/)    | Expensive but useful grammar and spell checker                                                                                  |
| [Obsidian](https://www.spectacleapp.com/)  | Note taking app with great plugins. I love that behind the scenes, it's all just simple mark down files in a repository.        |
| [Miro](https://miro.com/)                  | Whiteboard app that's great for collaboration and prototyping.                                                                  |
| [Gmail](https://gmail.com)                 | Email. It's fine. I use it. I like asynchronous communications. I'd like to switch to protonmail.                               |

| [Brave](https://brave.com/)                | I prefer to use Brave for my personal browsing. For work, I tend to use google chrome.                                          |
| [1Password](https://1password.com/)                                           | My preferred password manager. I've also used LastPass and KeepassX and found that I like the UI, UX, and sharing features of 1pass the most.                                                                                                                                |

## Development Tools

| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Github & Github Actions](https://github.com/)      | I use github for hosting a lot of data, even beyond code. I use github actions for most automation.                                                       |
| [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)                 | For quick and easy hosting, I use netlify.                                                                                                                |
| [VS Code ](https://code.visualstudio.com/)          | VSCode is my IDE of choice. I use vim mode.                                                                                                               |
| [Docker & Docker Compose ](https://www.docker.com/) | I like docker for quickly making reproduceable environments, like for running MySQL locally.                                                              |
| [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)               | I use pre-commit to auto-run a series of checks on code before committing. Super nice way to enforce formatting requriements before code even hits CI/CD. |

## Python Tools

This could, and should, be a post of its own.
These are the python tools that I use on almost every project.

| Tool                                     | Description                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)     | Poetry is my preferred dependency management system for python.                                                                                      |
| [Pylint](https://pylint.org/)            | I like to use pylint to enforce standards, coupled with VSCode's pylance. I prefer pylance over Jedi because of small stylistic choices in Jedi.     |
| [Black](https://github.com/psf/black)    | I love black for formatting. I like how I don't have to think about formatting. I like my collaborators and I never worry about formatting. Amazing. |
| [Isort](https://pypi.org/project/isort/) | Deterministic import sorting                                                                                                                         |
| [MyPy](http://mypy-lang.org/)            | Type checker                                                                                                                                         |
| [Datasette](https://datasette.io/)            | "Datasette is a tool for exploring and publishing data" - the datasette site. I really like the architecture concepts around it and how easy it is to use and deploy to do more sophisticated projects.                                                                                                                                         |

## Personal Finance Tools

| Tool   | Description                                                                                                                                          |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Personal Capital](https://www.personalcapital.com/) | Used for financial tracking. I used to use mint but didn't like their privacy policies. I'd love to write my own tool someday. I have so many ideas for the features I want. At the end of each month, I copy aggregate information from personal capital into a google sheet where I track things generally. That's where I make annotations and appropriate adjustments to get a real sense of my financial circumstances and history. I've been using the same spreadsheet for about 6 years now.                                                                                    |
