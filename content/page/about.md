## About

I am a software engineer who builds small apps and big apps, works on big problems and small problems, and enjoys experimenting with new technologies.

Iâ€™m currently CTO at Playground Labs (https://playgroundlabs.io), a group of folks creating community-first projects that enable people to build, earn, and socialize within web3.
