## What I'm Reading

- [Osmarks on how they datasette for their personal data warehouse](https://osmarks.net/maghammer/)
- [Osmarks on RSS](https://osmarks.net/rssgood/)
- [Osmarks meme search engine](https://mse.osmarks.net/)
- [Robin Sloan](https://www.robinsloan.com/) asking for "truly great author website" nominations [here](https://www.robinsloan.com/newsletters/what-would-a-wizard-read/#websites).
    - I'm interested in good websites, especially ones that promulgate or host information about a person or organization.
    - I also assist my partner Cat with their writing [site](https://catnesh.net).
- [Critical Ignoring as a Core Competence for Digital Citizens](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epub/10.1177/09637214221121570)
    - "We argue that digital information literacy must include the competence of critical ignoring—choosing what to ignore and where to invest one’s limited attentional capacities."
    - I like the concept of lateral reading, where a reader leaves a source quite quickly to verify who is behind it.
    - Found via [Robin Sloan's Newsletter](https://www.robinsloan.com/newsletters/what-would-a-wizard-read/)
- This [comment](https://lobste.rs/s/mbgpma/i_ve_been_employed_tech_for_years_i_ve#c_uq3a4j) on lobste.rs about IT rants
    - > IT rant checklist:
      > 
      >   - [x] Humble brag (I could do X in 10 min, people that take longer are dumb or lazy)
      >   - [x] Shitting on (a straw man/worse case scenario of) agile, then describing a solution that is … agile
      >   - [x] Hustle culture worship
      >   - [x] Absence of a point or conclusion
    - The comment dovetails nicely with the critical ignoring article above.
