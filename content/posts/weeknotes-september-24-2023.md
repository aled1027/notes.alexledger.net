Each thing I'm reading and thinking about gets its own section this week.

## The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral

This [essay](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/) (really a transcript of a talk) by Mike Caulfield is incredible. I'm still thinking about it, and it's undoubtedly already influencing my work. More notes on it to come.

I highly recommend reading this.

## SIFT

I've been thinking about how to browser the internet effectively, and I found a few more good resources on this.

- https://hapgood.us/2019/06/19/sift-the-four-moves/
- https://webliteracy.pressbooks.com/
- [https://human.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/...](https://human.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Research_and_Information_Literacy/Web_Literacy_for_Student_Fact-Checkers_(Caulfield))

I've skimmed these, but haven't had a chance to deep-dive yet.
 
## PageFind

I added search to this site!

Check it out at [/search](/search). It was made with [PageFind](https://pagefind.app/), which I found incredibly easy to use. Loving it so far.

## Responsive Web Design

My understanding is this post by Ethan Marcette in 2010 coined the term Responsive Web Design: https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/.

It's a great read on thinking about design for technical interfaces and building things that last, not just things that are cool for a week.


## Career Maps

This [page](https://tomcritchlow.com/2023/04/26/career-maps/) by Tom Critchlow shows career maps of different folks. It's cool to see the different visualizations of careers.

## Blog Roll

I like how Tracy Durnell writes about owning their follows in this [post](https://tracydurnell.com/2022/10/28/expanding-the-blogroll/).

## Upping my CSS Game

I was reading about https://buildexcellentwebsit.es/ to learn more about how to think about CSS and design.

Andy Bell also made https://every-layout.dev/, and there's this youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uhIiI9Ld5M) I have yet to watch.
