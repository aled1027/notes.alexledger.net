## Things I'm reading and thinking about

- Browsing through https://thesephist.com/ and their [projects](https://thesephist.com/projects/)
    - Their [stream](https://stream.thesephist.com/) is super cool. As they write on the [about page](https://stream.thesephist.com/about/), "You can think of this website like a less noisy, mini Twitter feed I've created just for myself and my updates on my work and thinking. It's a micro-blog in the truest sense of the word."
    - Source code [here](https://github.com/thesephist/stream).
- [The Hub](https://hub-alexledger-net.netlify.app/)
    - A quick site I wrote that takes a JSON file as input and presents the data as bookmarks
    - A nice way to capture sites and bookmarks and share them with others
    - Here's my primary version: https://hub-alexledger-net.netlify.app/?src=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/aled1027/61d6625a9cd18efaac91eb216c18a09e/raw/5b8c16dcd1d05817078218255dace384aae186c8/hub1.json
    - And the supporting JSON: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/aled1027/61d6625a9cd18efaac91eb216c18a09e/raw/5b8c16dcd1d05817078218255dace384aae186c8/hub1.json
- The [Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io) [live demo](https://pocketbase.io/demo/)
    - I love how different products approach live demos
    - In this one, they show a banner with the username and password, and you can log into the instance
    - At a regular interval, they reset the instance.


Things I learned
- Learned about intersection observer and used at https://about.kap.gg/
