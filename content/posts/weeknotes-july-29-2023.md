## What I've been working on

- [Researching Electric Vehicles and Bikes](https://www.alexledger.net/guides/electric_vehicles/)
- [The Hub](https://hub-alexledger-net.netlify.app/): A quick site I wrote that takes a JSON file as input and presents the data as bookmarks. It's a nice way to capture sites and bookmarks and share them with others
    - Here's my [primary version](https://hub-alexledger-net.netlify.app/?src=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/aled1027/61d6625a9cd18efaac91eb216c18a09e/raw/5b8c16dcd1d05817078218255dace384aae186c8/hub1.json) and the supporting [JSON](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/aled1027/61d6625a9cd18efaac91eb216c18a09e/raw/5b8c16dcd1d05817078218255dace384aae186c8/hub1.json)
- Barter, a trading system; [blog post](https://www.alexledger.net/posts/barter-a-trading-system/) and [code](https://github.com/aled1027/barter).
- I've been doing a lot of small frontend projects to improve my skills, including working on https://about.kap.gg at work.

## Things I'm reading and thinking about

- [The State of Web3 Game Developer Tooling](https://www.bitkraft.vc/the-state-of-web3-game-developer-tooling/)
- [Heatmap News](https://heatmap.news/)
- [Farewell Jamstack](https://www.spicyweb.dev/farewell-jamstack/)
- [Thinking about tech debt](https://apenwarr.ca/log/20230605 )
- [This SVG tutorial](https://www.nan.fyi/svg-paths)
- Reading about how [koding kitty](https://www.kodingkitty.com/) [builds](https://www.kodingkitty.com/blog/how-to-build-a-website/)
- Browsing through https://thesephist.com/ and their [projects](https://thesephist.com/projects/)
    - Their [stream](https://stream.thesephist.com/) is super cool. As they write on the [about page](https://stream.thesephist.com/about/), "You can think of this website like a less noisy, mini Twitter feed I've created just for myself and my updates on my work and thinking. It's a micro-blog in the truest sense of the word." Source code [here](https://github.com/thesephist/stream).
- The [Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io) [live demo](https://pocketbase.io/demo/). I love how different products approach live demos. In this one, they show a banner with the username and password, and you can log into the instance. At a regular interval, they reset the instance.
