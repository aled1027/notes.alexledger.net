I've been reading about digital gardens and different ways of writing, reading, navigating, and thinking about the internet knowledge experience.

In this post, I'm doing a quick experiment with https://quotebacks.net/, a tool by [Tom Critchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com/) and [Toby Shorin](https://tobyshorin.com/).

Here's a quote from a piece by Sam Peurifoy on NFT game economics, quoted with a link to the source. To make this, I used the form at https://quotebacks.net/ and pasted the generated html into a markdown file.

<blockquote class="quoteback" darkmode="" data-title="Fixing NFT Game Economics: Gladiators & Lumberjacks" data-author="Sam Peurifoy" cite="https://medium.com/@sampeurifoy/fixing-nft-game-economics-gladiators-lumberjacks-d3d832acb3a6">
<span style="color: rgb(36, 36, 36); font-family: source-serif-pro, Georgia, Cambria, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, Times, serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.06px;">Gladiators are players that are willing to risk assets in return for some potential greater reward. These are people that step into the arena, enjoy the grit of the sand between their teeth when they get stomped into the ground, and get back up the next day to rise stronger and dominate the competition, taking home all the beans.</span>

Toby Shorin on his [blog](https://subpixel.space/) has a more context-oriented version of this for quoting yourself: https://subpixel.space/entries/open-transclude/. [^1]

[^1]: As far as I can tell, one can only quote their own material with this tool because it relies on using `id` in the html of the quoted page.
