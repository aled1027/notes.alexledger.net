I just learned about the [IndieWeb Carnival](https://indieweb.org/indieweb-carnival), from reading Ben Werdmuller's November [contribution](https://werd.io/2023/belonging-and-community).

Alex Sirac describes the IndieWeb Carnival as:

> Every month, one person signs up to host the IndieWeb carnival. They choose a theme and encourage other people to write or create something about it. ([src](https://alexsirac.com/indieweb-carnival-community-and-belonging/))

In November, Alex Sirac provided the [prompt](https://alexsirac.com/indieweb-carnival-community-and-belonging/):

> Tell us something about community and belonging!

Alex goes into more detail with some questions to consider in their prompt post.

Posts from across the internet are stitched together with [webmentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention), which I've been wanting to learn more about. I really love the idea. I'm going to try to write something for the carnival, and if I don't make it, I'll try again next month.
