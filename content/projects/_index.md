Below is a list of the some of the projects I've worked on over the years. If you're interested in learning more about a project or collaborating, please reach out; I'd love to chat!

## The Hub

Given a link to a JSON file of links and labels, [The Hub](https://github.com/aled1027/the-hub) will populate an easy to navigate and use hub of the links. An alternative, shareable page of bookmarks inspired by LinkTree. ([code](https://github.com/aled1027/the-hub))


## Barter

[Barter](https://github.com/aled1027/barter) is a trading system for setting up generic, automated (but not real-time), trades. Currently, this system is built for dydx. ([code](https://github.com/aled1027/barter))

## Flattener

[Flattener](https://flattener.netlify.app/) is a tool for taking a nested JSON file as input and returning a CSV file with the data flattened. This was written as a project to play with [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/), a port of CPython to WebAssembly/Emscripten. such that the code for flattening the JSON imports pandas and uses `pd.json_normalize`. ([code](https://github.com/aled1027/flattener),[ hosted page](https://flattener.netlify.app/))

## This Site

This site, https://alexledger.net, is built with Hugo with some custom theming on top of [Hugo blog awesome](https://github.com/hugo-sid/hugo-blog-awesome). ([code](https://github.com/aled1027/notes.alexledger.net), [site](https://alexledger.net))

## Cat's Site

https://catnesh.net, the site of my partner, Cat, is a Hugo site that uses the CSS from [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) as basis of the theme. The site prioritizes accessibility as well as showing off Cat's work. ([site](https://catnesh.net))

## Blondel Communities

An implementation of Blondel et al.'s community detection algorithm in python. ([code](https://github.com/aled1027/blondel_communities))


## Tiny Ped Com

A small Rust library for Pedersen commitments over elliptic curves. ([code](https://github.com/aled1027/tiny_ped_com))

## Chaos in Schelling's Model

This project explored chaos and emergent properties in Schelling's Bounded Neighborhood model. This was work in 2015 for the Philosophy of Computation class at Reed, taught by Mark Bedau. ([code](https://github.com/aled1027/chaos_in_schellings_model))

## The Looming Threat of China: An Analysis of Chinese Influence on Bitcoin

A paper published October 5, 2018 on arXiv, presented at CESC 2018, in in collaboration with [Ben Kaiser](https://benkaiser.org/) and [Mireya Jurado](https://users.cs.fiu.edu/~mjura011/). ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02466), [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTP_JozfU0-GTYkkF2_XXh7rNGTuvqW8PKi0MxIiAfefHJmKy0-v-ag-j3yJFK7LFoBI3bshCx1Vm3U/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.g43a3dcadcd_0_0), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylhCVZPhdNw), [code](https://github.com/aled1027/looming_threat_of_china_analysis))

## Externally Verifiable Oblivious RAM

_Externally Verifiable Oblivious RAM_ is a paper published at the Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS) in July 2017. This was advised by [Adam Groce](https://people.reed.edu/~agroce/index.html) and in collaboration with Josh Gancher. ([paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/008.pdf))


## CompGC: Efficient Offline/Online Semi-honest Two-party Computation,

_CompGC: Efficient Offline/Online Semi-honest Two-party Computation_, is a paper written in 2017, as part of my senior thesis at Reed, on a novel technique for efficient two-party-computation. This was a collaboration with [Adam Groce](https://people.reed.edu/~agroce/index.html) (my thesis advisor), Arkady Yerukhimovich and Alex Malozemoff. ([paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/458.pdf), [code](https://github.com/aled1027/CompGC))
