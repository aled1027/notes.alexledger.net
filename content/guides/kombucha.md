| SCOBY | Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast. The culture that ferments the tea and sugar into kombucha. |


## The Recipe I Use

I use a recipe that's derived from Sandor Katz's [The Art of Fermentation](https://www.wildfermentation.com/the-art-of-fermentation/).

This recipe makes 1 gallon of kombucha over approximately 7 days. To scale to larger or smaller amounts, adjust the ingredient amounts proportionally.

### Ingredients

| Ingredients                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 4 tablespoons black tea (enough to make 16 cups of tea) |
| 1 cup cane sugar                                        |
| 1 gallon water                                          |
| SCOBY                                                   |
| **<u>Equipment</u>**                                    |
| 1 gallon jar                                            |
| Filter / sieve                                          |
| Towel for covering kombucha                             |
| Rubber band for holding the towel                       |

### Steps

1. Make 4 cups of tea concentrate
    1. Heat 4 cups of water to boiling
    2. Add 4 tablespoons of black tea (or enough to make 16 cups of tea)
    3. Brew for 10 to 15 minutes
2. Add 1 cup of sugar to the tea concentrate and dissolve the sugar in
3. Pour the water into a gallon jar
    - If needed, cool the water a bit first. You can add a few ice cubes or dilute with water from the next step
4. Add 12 cups of water to the jar. Stir to mix.
    - Usually I added about 11 to 11.5 cups so there's head room
5. Verify the water is cool, below about 80 degrees F. If not, add ice cubes to cool it down.
6. Add the SCOBY
    - I usually add the SCOBY structure and additional kombucha from a previous batch
7. Cover the jar with a cloth and rubber band
8. Put in a dry, warmish location for 7 days
9. After 7 days, taste the kombucha. If it's too sweet, let it ferment longer. If it's too sour, ferment less next time.
    - Also, feel free to taste at any point during the fermentation process and adjust the timing accordingly
10. When the kombucha is ready, remove the SCOBY and store it in a jar with some kombucha from the batch
11. (Optional) Flavor it and bubble it.
    - Pour the kombucha into a bottle with some fruit.[^1]
    - Let it sit for a day or two before filtering out the bits and pouring into another bottle to store in the refrigerator.


## Cost Analysis

This section breaks down the cost of making a gallon of kombucha.


| Ingredient                   | Store Price         | Price per batch (gallon) |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 4 T (0.03 pounds) black tea  | $36.80 / pound [^2] | $1.10 / batch            |
| 1 C (0.44 pounds) cane sugar | $1.99 / pound [^3]  | $0.88 / batch            |
| 1 gallon water               | -                   | -                        |
| SCOBY                        | -                   | -                        |
| **TOTAL**                    | -                   | $1.98 / gallon batch     |


At $1.98 per gallon of kombucha, that's $0.19 per 12 ounces, which is the typical bottle size at the store. A bottle often costs about $3.50 at the store, so that's a 95% savings.
